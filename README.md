## Installation
**Warning:** As the app contains scary (at least they seem scary for Windows Defender, lol) byte arrays, Defender deletes built binaries. Please exclude the binaries in Windows Defender settings. **You shouldn't trust me. If you don't, build an app yourself.** Also if you weren't RAT'd after using my builds, put a rocket emotion on the release idk.

### Downloading prebuilt binaries
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Eimaen/JustAsPlanned/releases) page and download latest version.
2. Open it (Steam has to be running too).

### DIY guide
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open it with Visual Studio.
3. Build the project and run.
